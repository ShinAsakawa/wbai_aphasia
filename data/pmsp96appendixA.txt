# Note. The regular consistent words, regular inconsistent words, and exception words are from Experiments 1 and 2 of Taraban and McClelland (1987). In those studies, the regular consistent words are the control words for the exception words. In addition, each regular inconsistent word shares a body with some exception word. The ambiguous words contain bodies associated with two or more pronunciations, each of which occurs in many words. They were generated by Seidenberg and McClelland (1989) to be matched in frequency (Kufera & Francis, 1967) with the Taraban and McClelland high- and low-frequency regular consistent and exception words. The nonwords were generated by altering the onsets of the exception words.
